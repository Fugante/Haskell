## Exercises: Understanding Folds

1. `foldr(*) 1 [1..5]`

    b. `foldl (*) 1 [1..5]`

    c. `foldl (flip (*)) 1 [1..5]`

2. `foldl (flip (*)) 1 [1..3]`
    ```
    foldl (flip (*)) 1 [1..3]
    foldl(flip (*)) 1 [1,2,3]
    foldl (flip (*)) (1*1) [2,3]
    foldl (flip (*)) (1*1*(2)) [3]
    foldl (flip (*)) (1*1*(2*(3))) []
    (1*1*(2*(3)))
    (1*1*(6))
    (1*6)
    6
    ```

3. One difference between `foldr` and `foldl` is:

    c. `foldr`, but not `foldl`, associates to the right

4. Folds are catamorphisms, which means they are generally used to

    a. reduce structure

5. The following are simple folds very similar to what youâ€™v already seen, but each has 
at least one error. Please fix them and test in your REPL:

    a. `foldr (++) ["woot", "WOOT", "woot"]`
    - Fix: `foldr (++) "" ["woot", "WOOT", "woot"]`

    b. `foldr max [] "fear is the little death"`
    - Fix: `foldr max 'a' ["fear is the little death"]`

    c. `foldr and True [False, True]`
    - Fix: `foldr (&&) True [False, True]`

    d. Can it everreturn a different answer? `foldr (||) True [False, True]`
    - `foldr (||) False [False, True]`

    e. `foldl ((++) . show) "" [1..5]`
    - Fix: `foldl (\acc x -> acc ++ show x) "" [1..5]`

    f. `foldr const 'a' [1..5]`
    - Fix: `foldl const 'a' [1..5]`

    g. `foldr const 0 "tacos"`
    - Fix: `foldl const 0 "tacos"`

    h. `foldl (flip const) 0 "burritos"`
    -Fix: `foldr (flip const) 0 "burritos"`

    i. `foldl (flip const) 'z' [1..5]`
    -Fix: `foldr (flip const) 'z' [1..5]`


## Exercises: Database Processing

```
import Data.Time


data DatabaseItem =
    DbString String
    | DbNumber Integer
    | DbDate UTCTime
    deriving(Eq, Ord, Show)

theDatabase :: [DatabaseItem]
theDatabase =
    [
        DbDate (UTCTime (fromGregorian 1911 5 1) (secondsToDiffTime 34123)),
        DbNumber 9001,
        DbString "Hello, world!",
        DbDate (UTCTime (fromGregorian 1921 5 1) (secondsToDiffTime 34123))
    ]
```

1.
    ```
    filterDbDate :: [DatabaseItem] -> [UTCTime]
    filterDbDate = foldr go []
        where
            go dbItem acc = case dbItem of
                DbDate time -> time : acc
                _ -> acc
    ```

2.
    ```
    filterDbNumber :: [DatabaseItem] -> [Integer]
    filterDbNumber = foldr go []
        where
            go dbItem acc = case dbItem of
                DbNumber number -> number : acc
                _ -> acc
    ```

3.
    ```
    mostRecent :: [DatabaseItem] -> UTCTime
    mostRecent = foldr go farest . filterDbDate
        where
            go dbDate closest = if dbDate > closest then dbDate else closest
            farest = UTCTime (fromGregorian 0 0 0) (secondsToDiffTime 0)
    ```

4.
    ```
    sumDb :: [DatabaseItem] -> Integer
    sumDb = sum . filterDbNumber
    ```

5.
    ```
    avgDb :: [DatabaseItem] -> Double
    avgDb = avg . filterDbNumber
        where
            avg :: [Integer] -> Double
            avg xs = s / l
                where
                    s = fromIntegral $ sum xs
                    l = fromIntegral $ length xs
    ```


## Scans Exercises

```
fibs = 1 : scanl (+) 1 fibs
fibsN x = fibs !! x
```

1.
    ```
    fibs20 :: [Integer]
    fibs20 = take 20 $ 1 : scanl (+) 1 fibs
    ```

2.
    ```
    fibsLT100 :: [Integer]
    fibsLT100 = [x | x <- fibs, x < 100]
    ```

3.
    ```
    factorial :: [Integer]
    factorial = scanl (*) 1 [2..]
    ```


## Chapter Exercises

### Warm-up and Review

1.
    ```
    stops  = "pbtdkg"
    vowels = "aeiou"
    ```

    a.
    ```
    stopVowelStop = [(s, v, s') | s <- stops, v <- vowels, s' <- stops]
    ```

    b.
    ```
    stopVowelsStop' = [('p', v, s') | v <- vowels, s' <- stops]
    ```

    c.
    ```
    nounVerbNoun :: [String] -> [String] -> [String]
    nounVerbNoun nouns verbs = [n ++ v ++ n' | n <- nouns, v <- verbs, n' <- nouns]
    ```

2.
    ```
    seekritFunc x = div (sum (map length (words x))) (length (words x))
    ```
    Gives the ratio of letters to words in a sentence.

3.
    ```
    seekritFunc' :: Fractional a => String -> a
    seekritFunc' x = y / z
        where y = fromIntegral $ sum $ map length $ words x
            z = fromIntegral $ length $ words x
    ```

### Rewriting functions using folds

1.
    ```
    myOr :: [Bool] -> Bool
    myOr = foldr (||) False
    ```

2.
    ```
    myAny :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> Bool
    myAny f = myOr . map f
    ```

3.
    ```
    myElem :: Eq a => a -> [a] -> Bool
    myElem a = foldr go False
        where
            go x acc = acc || a == x

    myElem' :: Eq a => a -> [a] -> Bool
    myElem' a = any (a==)
    ```
